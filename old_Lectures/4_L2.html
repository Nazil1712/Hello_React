    <!-- We have written type="module" because earlier 

        **************
                To run this as React, you need to write command:
                npx parcel 4_L2.html
        **************
    
        <script src="./4_L2.js"></script>
        Browser understand this as normal Js file and normal js file doesn't have import and exports right,

        hence we have to tell that this is not normal Js file this is module

    <script src="./4_L2.js" type="module"></script>
